If food does not contain allergies
If food does not contain interactions
If food calories does not exceed RDI 
If food nutrient does not exceed RDI
If meal is eaten, does it meet RDI?






Step1: Collect Images of African Food Data
Step 1b: Collect facts about Food
Step2: Annotate and segment images
Step 2b: Build CNN ResNet Network
Step 3: Train the model using YOLOV8 for Instance segmentation
Step 4: Incorporate Depth Volume Ratio
Step 6: Go meet Sickle Cell disease nutritionists and Doctors collect Sickle Cell Facts such as drug interaction, allergies, time dependencies.
Step 9: Build Decision Making Engine using conditional programming, RDI and SCD Facts
Step 10: Evaluate Efficacy of MORGAN against real world dieticians
Step 11: Evaluate Accuracy of CNN ResNet

Step 12: Fine Tune LLM/GPT Model with CustomDataSet
Pass in user input, age and sex as predefined prompt
Create a  set of predefined prompts
